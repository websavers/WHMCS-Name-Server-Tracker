# WHMCS Name Server Tracker #

## Summary ##

This module automatically pulls all name servers across all hosting services into
a comprehensive report for easy reference and tracking purposes. It further allows
you to manually add name servers that do not already exist in the system and will
not be associated with 'sold' services in WHMCS.

Future expansion will include integrating with the appropriate registrar API to 
automatically handle the name server registration process.

## Minimum Requirements ##

This module was built to work with WHMCS 7.7.1 on PHP 7.2+ and may not work with
earlier versions of either WHMCS or PHP. We will not supply support for versions
less than these.

## Tests ##

None yet.
